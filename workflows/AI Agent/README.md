üß™ Sample Interaction Examples
Contact Lookup Scenario
User: "I need John Smith's email address"
AI Response: "Let me check the database... According to the database, John Smith's email is: john.smith@company.com. Database last updated: [timestamp]"
Email Composition Scenario
User: "Send a follow-up email to Sarah about tomorrow's meeting"
AI Process:

‚úÖ Database Lookup: Retrieves Sarah's verified email address
‚úÖ Time Calculation: Interprets "tomorrow" based on current context
‚úÖ Email Generation: Creates professional follow-up message from Muaaz
‚úÖ Automated Sending: Dispatches email via Gmail integration

Data Integrity Example
User: "What's the email for XYZ Company?"
AI Response: "I searched the database but could not locate an email address for XYZ Company. Would you like me to search using different criteria?"
