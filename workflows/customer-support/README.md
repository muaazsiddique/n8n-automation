## üéØ Project Overview

Built an intelligent email automation system that monitors Gmail, classifies incoming emails, and automatically responds to customer support inquiries using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system powered by OpenAI GPT-4 and Pinecone vector database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. Email Monitoring & Trigger Setup
- **Gmail Trigger Node**: Monitors incoming emails every minute
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 for secure Gmail access  
- **Real-time Detection**: Automated detection of new customer inquiries
- **Continuous Operation**: 24/7 monitoring without manual intervention

### 2. Intelligent Email Classification
**AI-Powered Text Classifier using OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini**

Categorizes emails into 8 distinct categories:
- ‚úâÔ∏è **Customer Support** - Login issues, product help, account questions
- üîß **Technical Support** - API errors, system crashes, integration problems  
- üíº **Sales & Marketing** - Pricing, demos, partnerships
- üí≥ **Billing & Payments** - Invoices, payment issues, refunds
- üìù **Feedback & Reviews** - Product feedback, feature requests
- üö® **Urgent/Priority** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **General Inquiry** - Business hours, company info
- üö´ **Spam/Irrelevant** - Filters unwanted communications

### 3. Knowledge Base Integration (RAG System)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for storing company policies and FAQs
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI Embeddings for semantic search capabilities
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate responses
- **Namespace**: "FAQ" namespace for organized knowledge retrieval
- **Semantic Search**: Context-aware information retrieval

### 4. AI Agent Response Generation
- **Language Model**: OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini as core AI engine
- **System Prompt**: "You are a helpful assistant and will answer from knowledgebase"
- **Grounded Responses**: All answers based on actual company documentation
- **Consistency**: Maintains alignment with company policies and procedures

### 5. Automated Response Workflow
**Smart Routing Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **Customer Support emails** ‚Üí Routed to AI Agent for intelligent response generation
- ‚ùå **Non-support emails** ‚Üí Directed to "No Operation" node (no automated response)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Spam Protection** ‚Üí Prevents irrelevant emails from triggering unnecessary replies

### 6. Email Reply Automation
- **Gmail Reply Node**: Automatically responds to original email thread
- **Thread Continuity**: Maintains conversation by replying to same message ID
- **Contextual Responses**: Sends appropriate responses without human intervention
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean formatting without attribution
